Hello! My name is Yifei Chen and I enjoy design and creating new things both in real life and on the internet. I finished my master degree of Architecture at [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/).
I have great interest in computer science and love to use programming software and parametric design tools to accomplish design in architecture and other objects. I started leaning Java in 2020 and designed and built
several full-stack projects. I am looking for a full-time software engineer position.

Today, I'm working at [Minno Wasko](http://www.minnowasko.com/mw/), and I've had the privilege of working at [GMP](https://www.gmp.de/en/), [FOX Architects](https://www.fox-architects.com/), and [GRO Architects](https://www.groarc.com/).
